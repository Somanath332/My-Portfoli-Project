    <h2><u>Objective:</u></h5>
    <p>
        This project presents the design and construction of a solar dryer by Forced Convection. The
        dryer is composed of solar collector, a fan and a solar drying chamber constraining rack of three
        trays both being integrated together. The air allowed in through air inlet is heated up in the
        solar collector and channeled through the drying chamber where it is utilized in drying. The
        design and data were obtained for proper design specification. Locally available material were
        used for the construction, namely comprising of wood, glass, aluminum metal sheet, fan and net
        trays. The rapid rate of drying by forced convection in the dryer as compared to drying with
        natural convection revels its ability to dry food items reasonable rapid pace to remove moisture.

    <h1 style="font-size: 180%; color: #58dede;">Online Clinic System</h1>
    <pre>
        * The main aim of the project is to consult the doctors for the health issues in Online rather than in offline which reduces time
        * we created application for this online clinic system by using-
            Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
            Back-End: Springboot, Hibernate
            DataBase: MySql
        * when we open the application the user(Patient)sees the home screen of the application which shows the icons -
            Home
            Doctor
            Patient
            Admin
            Reach Us
        <h2 style="font-size: 90%; color: #58dede;">DOCTOR:</h2>
        The doctor has to register to the appliaction by giving his details like
            > Name
            > Email
            > Password
            > Qualification
            > Mob.no
        The doctor detais will saved in the database and will be visible to the users which doctors are available according to the health issue.
        <h2 style="font-size: 90%; color: #58dede;">PATIENT:</h2>
        When the user(patient) is visting the application for the first time he/she has to click on the patient icon then they will be redirected to the patient <br>login page
        If he/she is first time visting the application then they have to first register by giving the basic details
            > Name
            > Email
            > Password
            > Age
            > Disease
            > Address
            > Mob.no
        Then they have to login by using their login Credentials, after that they can book the appointment from the list of doctors shown.
        After that the appointment will be went to the admin so that the admin will intimate the doctor about the patient and the timings.
        <h2 style="font-size: 90%; color: #58dede;">ADMIN:</h2>
        The admin have all the access to the application for doing the CRUD operations.
